The app installation and the repository must both belong to the same organization on GitHub. Note: you can review your organization's installations by the following the instructions at this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/reviewing-your-organizations-installed-integrations).

## Example Usage

## Import

GitHub App Installation Repository can be imported using an ID made up of `installation_id:repository`, e.g.

terraform import github_app_installation_repository.terraform_repo 1234567:terraform
```
