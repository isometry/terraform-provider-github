~> **Note**: This resource is not compatible with the GitHub App Installation authentication method.

This resource manages relationships between app installations and repositories in your GitHub organization.

Creating this resource installs a particular app on multiple repositories.

The app installation and the repositories must all belong to the same organization on GitHub. Note: you can review your organization's installations by the following the instructions at this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/reviewing-your-organizations-installed-integrations).

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/github_app_installation_repositories/example_1.tf"}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

GitHub App Installation Repositories can be imported using an ID made up of `installation_id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import github_app_installation_repositories.some_app_repos 1234567
```
