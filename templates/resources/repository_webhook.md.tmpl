# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

This resource allows you to create and manage webhooks for repositories within your GitHub organization or personal account.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/github_repository_webhook/example_1.tf"}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

Repository webhooks can be imported using the `name` of the repository, combined with the `id` of the webhook, separated by a `/` character. The `id` of the webhook can be found in the URL of the webhook. For example: `"https://github.com/foo-org/foo-repo/settings/hooks/14711452"`.

Importing uses the name of the repository, as well as the ID of the webhook, e.g.

```shell
terraform import github_repository_webhook.terraform terraform/11235813
```

If secret is populated in the webhook's configuration, the value will be imported as "********".
