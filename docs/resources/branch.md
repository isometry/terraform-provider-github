# github_branch (Resource)

This resource allows you to create and manage branches within your repository.

Additional constraints can be applied to ensure your branch is created from another branch or commit.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "github_branch" "development" {
  repository = "example"
  branch     = "development"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `branch` (String) The repository branch to create.
- `repository` (String) The GitHub repository name.

### Optional

- `source_branch` (String) The branch name to start from. Defaults to 'main'.
- `source_sha` (String) The commit hash to start from. Defaults to the tip of 'source_branch'. If provided, 'source_branch' is ignored.

### Read-Only

- `etag` (String) An etag representing the Branch object.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `ref` (String) A string representing a branch reference, in the form of 'refs/heads/<branch>'.
- `sha` (String) A string storing the reference's HEAD commit's SHA1.

## Import

GitHub Branch can be imported using an ID made up of `repository:branch`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import github_branch.terraform terraform:main
```

Importing github branch into an instance object (when using a for each block to manage multiple branches)

```shell
terraform import github_branch.terraform["terraform"] terraform:main
```

Optionally, a source branch may be specified using an ID of `repository:branch:source_branch`. This is useful for importing branches that do not branch directly off main.

```shell
terraform import github_branch.terraform terraform:feature-branch:dev
```
