# github_issue_label (Resource)

Provides a GitHub issue label resource.

This resource allows you to create and manage issue labels within your GitHub organization.

Issue labels are keyed off of their "name", so pre-existing issue labels result in a 422 HTTP error if they exist outside of Terraform. Normally this would not be an issue, except new repositories are created with a "default" set of labels, and those labels easily conflict with custom ones.

This resource will first check if the label exists, and then issue an update, otherwise it will create.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a new, red colored label
resource "github_issue_label" "test_repo" {
  repository = "test-repo"
  name       = "Urgent"
  color      = "FF0000"
}
```

## Schema

- `name` (String) The name of the label.
- `repository` (String) The GitHub repository.

### Optional

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the issue label (repository:name).
- `url` (String) The URL to the issue label.

## Import

GitHub Issue Labels can be imported using an ID made up of `repository:name`, e.g.

terraform import github_issue_label.panic_label terraform:panic
```
