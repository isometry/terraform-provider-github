# github_emu_group_mapping (Resource)

This resource manages mappings between external groups for enterprise managed users and GitHub teams. It wraps the API detailed [here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/teams#external-groups). Note that this is a distinct resource from `github_team_sync_group_mapping`. `github_emu_group_mapping` is special to the Enterprise Managed User (EMU) external group feature, whereas `github_team_sync_group_mapping` is specific to Identity Provider Groups.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "github_emu_group_mapping" "example_emu_group_mapping" {
  team_slug = "emu-test-team" # The GitHub team name to modify
  group_id  = 28836           # The group ID of the external group to link
}

# Note that here GITHUB_OWNER and GITHUB_TOKEN have been set in the environment.
```
