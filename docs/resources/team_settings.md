# github_team_settings (Resource)

This resource manages the team settings (in particular the request review delegation settings) within the organization

Creating this resource will alter the team Code Review settings.

The team must both belong to the same organization configured in the provider on GitHub.

~> **Note**: This resource relies on the v4 GraphQl GitHub API. If this API is not available, or the Stone Crop schema preview is not available, then this resource will not work as intended.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Add a repository to the team
resource "github_team" "some_team" {
  name        = "SomeTeam"
  description = "Some cool team"
}

resource "github_team_settings" "code_review_settings" {
  team_id = github_team.some_team.id
  review_request_delegation {
    algorithm    = "ROUND_ROBIN"
    member_count = 1
    notify       = true
  }
}
```
