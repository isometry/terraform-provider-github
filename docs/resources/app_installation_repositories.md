# github_app_installation_repositories (Resource)

~> **Note**: This resource is not compatible with the GitHub App Installation authentication method.

This resource manages relationships between app installations and repositories in your GitHub organization.

Creating this resource installs a particular app on multiple repositories.

The app installation and the repositories must all belong to the same organization on GitHub. Note: you can review your organization's installations by the following the instructions at this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/reviewing-your-organizations-installed-integrations).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create some repositories.
resource "github_repository" "some_repo" {
  name = "some-repo"
}

resource "github_repository" "another_repo" {
  name = "another-repo"
}

resource "github_app_installation_repositories" "some_app_repos" {
  # The installation id of the app (in the organization).
  installation_id       = "1234567"
  selected_repositories = [github_repository.some_repo.name, github_repository.another_repo.name]
}
```
